      <p>Welcome to the 2011 Physsoc LaTeX Session!<p>

      <h2>Download LaTeX</h2>

      <p>The first thing you'll need to do today is install LaTeX on
      your own computer.  There are several different ways to get LaTeX,
      depending on what operating system you use.<p>

      <h3>Linux</h3>

      <p>The simplest way to install LaTeX under Linux is to use your
      distribution's package manager.<p>

      <p>Ubuntu and Debian users can enter the following in a
      terminal:</p>

      <code>
        $ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended
      </code>

      <h3>Windows</h3>

      <p>The easiest way to get LaTeX on Windows is to download and
      install MikTeX.  MikTeX gives you a full LaTeX distribution along
      with a nice editor and all the required programs to use LaTeX.
      It also comes with its own package manager, which makes it easy to
      download and install new LaTeX addons.</p>

      <p>You can download MikTeX <a
      href="http://miktex.org/2.9/setup">here</a>.  Scroll down to
      <em>"Basic MiKTeX 2.9" Installer</em> and click on the
      <em>Download</em> button.</p>

      <h3>Mac OSX</h3>

      <p>The preferred way to obtain LaTeX for OSX appears to be to
      install MacTeX, which can be obtained <a
        href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Download and Install RevTeX</h2>

      <p>You can download RevTeX from <a
        href="https://authors.aps.org/revtex4/index.html">the APS
        website</a>.  If you're running Linux, you should download and
      install the file from there.  Just download it, unzip it, and
      follow the instructions in the README.</p>

      <p>On Windows, you can install RevTeX from MikTeX's package
      manager.  The package you want to look for is simply called
      "revtex".  It should take care of everything.</p>

      <p>Under OSX, you should be able to simply follow the same
      procedure as for Linux.</p>

      <h2>Get the Template File</h2>

      <p>For this session, you will be using a template which we have
      prepared for you.  It demonstrates many basic features that you
      will use all the time.  After installing LaTeX, your next step
      should be to download and unpack the template.<p>

      <p><a
        href="latex_session_2011.tar.bz2">latex_session_2011.tar.bz2</a>
      (for Linux)</p>

      <p><a href="latex_session_2011.zip">latex_session_2011.zip</a>
      (for Windows and OSX)</p>

      <h2>Useful Documentation</h2>

      <p>This LaTeX session can only teach you the basics.  To really
      get down to using LaTeX, you'll need some good documentation to
      refer to.  Fortunately, since LaTeX is so widely used, there are
      lots of good references to be found.<p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A good starting point is the <a
          href="http://www.latex-project.org/">official LaTeX Project
          web site</a> which has links to many guides and also has a
          good list of books about LaTeX.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/">Wikibooks
          LaTeX</a> guide is another excellent and quite comprehensive
        resource which is loaded with information.
